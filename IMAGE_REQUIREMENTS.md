# Image Requirements for Cleaning Services

## Required Image
You need to add a cleaning services image to complete the integration:

**File:** `img/service-cleaning.jpg`

**Specifications:**
- Dimensions: 500px x 300px (or higher resolution with same aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Content: Professional cleaning scene (domestic or commercial)
- Alt text already set: "Professional Cleaning Services"

**Suggested Image Content:**
- Professional cleaner in action
- Clean, modern kitchen or living room
- Commercial office cleaning
- End of tenancy cleaning scene

**Where to get images:**
- Stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay)
- Professional photography
- Ensure you have rights to use the image

**Note:** Until you add this image, a broken image icon will appear on the homepage services grid. The rest of the functionality is fully working.

## Optional Enhancement Images
For the cleaning.html page content (currently using placeholder service icons), you could add:
- `img/cleaning-domestic.jpg`
- `img/cleaning-office.jpg`
- `img/cleaning-tenancy.jpg`
- `img/cleaning-airbnb.jpg`

These are optional as the page currently uses Font Awesome icons which work well.
